## **Overview**  
In this lab, I focused on refreshing my knowledge of MATLAB, particularly its application in manipulating 2D image data. The tasks involved rotating and shearing a grayscale image.

## **Task 0: Learning MATLAB Basics**  
The first task was to complete the introductory course on MATLAB Academy, which covers all the essential basics needed to use MATLAB effectively. This course was really helpful in refreshing my MATLAB knowledge. Although I had used MATLAB for signal processing during my undergraduate course, I needed a revision. The course covered everything I needed, including arrays, plots, matrices, and other key concepts, helping me get back up to speed with MATLAB coding.

After completing the course, I moved on to the next step of the lab, which involved performing some image manipulations. I uploaded the image into the MATLAB folder and loaded it using the command:
```matlab
>> load clown
